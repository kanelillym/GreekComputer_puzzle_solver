# "Greek Computer" coffee-table puzzle solver

This program brute-force solves a coffee-table puzzle I was given for christmas which seemed infeasible to solve manually.

## Puzzle Description
The puzzle is made up of a round base plate and four rotatable plates stacked on top of it, pinned together in their center. Each plate has up to four rings of twelve 'number slots' which contain a non-zero positive integer OR have been cut out of the plate to show numbers on a lower plate. The goal is to rotate the four plates so that each radial column of visible numbers adds to 42.
It is named the "Greek Computer" because it is stylistically modelled after the [Antikythera Mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism).
